Can we really move this fast and still create intelligent things? What about the Thinking Eye? What about pondering? I've rarely gotten inspiration while moving at the speed of sound. And yet, here we are, moving at the speed of sound. What about the need to let ideas ferment? What if they'd given Van Gogh one afternoon to paint his Almond Blossom? I can tell you this: it wouldn't have been listed among his great paintings. In fact, I'd suppose it would have been considered the work of his 6 year old son, Vinnie, and put in the basement of the museum as marginally amusing, only to be brought out after dark or when the Alpine Elementary 4th grade class drops in on their annual spring fieldtrip. 
## I could go on, so why don't I? 
Dave Weckl, a master drummer, once shared the concept of playing "backwards." What he meant by that was playing, for example, a basic rock groove, but with a twist: offset the downbeat by an eighth note. The effect is mind-blowing and not something you'd try while playing at a dance club or the dancers will hate you. But he didn't invent or perfect this amazing concept in a few hours. What if he had been rushed: "Whoa, David! What was THAT? Now stop it and get back to the downbeat already. And uh one, and uh two, and a one, two, three, four!" 

So do you get the picture yet? In the words of Abraham Lincoln: 
>To rush your work is folly; to be first is, in time, to be last. Mark my words!
